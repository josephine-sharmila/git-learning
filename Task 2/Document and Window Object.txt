The difference between document and window object

The document and window objects are the objects whose interfaces you generally use most often in 
DOM programming. In simple terms, the window object represents something like the browser, and the 
document object is the root of the document itself. Element inherits from the generic Node interface, 
and together these two interfaces provide many of the methods and properties you use on individual 
elements.

Window Objects: The Window object is a global object in client-side JavaScript, representing the 
browser window containing a DOM document and acting as the root of the document object model.The window 
object, supported by all browsers, represents the browser’s window and automatically includes global 
JavaScript objects, functions, and variables as members.The Window object is responsible for managing 
global variables, functions, and objects, providing methods for browser interaction and managing 
properties related to frames, tabs, or windows, such as alert(), confirm(), setTimeout(), and 
setInterval().

Few Properties and Methods of window objects are,

Properties:
window.innerHeight - the inner height of the browser window (in pixels)
window.innerWidth - the inner width of the browser window (in pixels)
Methods:
window.open() - open a new window
window.close() - close the current window
window.moveTo() - move the current window
window.resizeTo() - resize the current window

Document Objects: The Document object is the HTML document that appears in the browser window and 
serves as an interface for interacting with the web page’s content. The browser generates a Document 
Object Model of a web page upon loading it.

The DOM manipulation tool offers methods to access and manipulate the structure and content of a document, 
such as getElementById(), querySelector(), createElement(), and innerHTML. It represents the entire HTML 
document as a node tree, with the Document object as the root node. It allows dynamic updates and 
interactions with web page content.

Few properties and methods of Document Object Model,

Properties
element.innerHTML = new html content//Change the inner HTML of an element
element.attribute = new value//Change the attribute value of an HTML element

Methods
document.createElement(element)//Create an HTML element
document.removeChild(element)//Remove an HTML element

Conclusion
Understanding the differences between Window and Document objects is crucial in JavaScript and web 
development. Window manages browser interactions, while Document acts as an interface for content 
manipulation. Using these functionalities allows developers to create interactive web experiences.
